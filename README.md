## obsidian-memo project
Hi there! 👋 \
At first, this project was just a simple automatic backup of my Obsidian files using Bash and cron — but then I decided to experiment with different types of dynamic content and API integration. \
The following sections of this README are updated on a schedule and include AI-generated content. The same goes for commit messages, which are also generated automatically.

## digital fragments: Liz's journal
hi, i'm Liz! i write code for a living and live in a city where neon spills through windows at all hours and the gentle thrum of servers feels more like home than silence

this is my journal—thoughts captured during deep focus hours when the world gets quiet and the real work begins. debugging sessions, random observations, the way my cat kiku judges my life choices, moments when the city shows its softer edges
started keeping this because days blur together too easily and i want to remember them better, make each one feel more distinct. the technical victories, the philosophical rabbit holes, the way code sometimes teaches you things about breathing... or hidden patterns in everyday chaos

mostly i write for myself, but maybe someone else will find something familiar here—the rhythm of problem-solving, the comfort of mechanical keyboards, the strange intimacy of a city that's learned to pulse with your heartbeat
welcome to the archive of small revelations 🌙

### 20 aug 2025 
**kiku's quiet heat map 🐾**

3:30 am. settled deep in the corner nest, tablet glow painting the floor. outside, the city's pulse, a distant thrum.

kiku, a soft, ginger weight, shifted again in her repurposed takeout box, head nestled into that familiar spot. i'd noticed it before, how she always favored certain corners of her cable nest. my fingers, tracing a stubborn circuit diagram, idly brushed the dark plastic near her. warm. a distinct, low warmth radiating from the coiled power lines beneath. not just body heat. she wasn't just comfy. she was mapping my circuit's thermal inefficiencies, a living, furry diagnostic tool. all this time, i'd been chasing phantom heat, and kiku, the ultimate low-power sensor, had been silently highlighting the hotspots in my organized chaos.

the answers sometimes arrive from the least expected, purring sources. a quiet, organic algorithm at work 💡

### The citadel in Bonifacio, Southern Corsica, France
![Bing](https://img.peapix.com/d9fc1b8b66364204b057915ba14ea47f_1920.jpg)

Set at Corsica's southern edge, Bonifacio looks out across a narrow strait to Sardinia, its limestone cliffs towering above the waves. Bonifacio didn't begin as a picturesque tourist destination—it was originally established as a coastal fortification and has spent centuries guarding one of the Mediterranean's busiest sea lanes. Established in 828 CE by Boniface II of Tuscany, the commune gradually became a meeting point for traders, soldiers and sailors—each group contributing to the evolution of the town's structure. Bonifacio is divided into two sections, with the 'vieille ville' (old town)—also known as 'la Haute Ville' (the Upper City)—standing on a high cliff within the original citadel walls. Below, the marine area lines the narrow inlet with harbours, waterfront homes and a growing valley community.

While here, the Bonifacio Citadel is a must-see. First built in the 9th century and expanded over time, it invites visitors to wander through quiet passageways, old military buildings and cobblestone streets. Nearby, you can explore the Marine Cemetery, climb the King of Aragon's Stairway and visit the Bastion de l'Étendard, now home to a small museum.

## natural wonder of the day
### Cappadocia Fairy Chimneys, Turkey


Step into an otherworldly realm where nature's artistry defies imagination: the captivating Fairy Chimneys of Cappadocia. Located in central Turkey, this enchanting region is defined by its dramatic, sculptural desert rock formations. These geological marvels were sculpted over an astonishing 60 million years, born from ancient volcanic eruptions. The colossal volcanoes of Hasadağı, Erciyes, and Göllüdağ blanketed the landscape with soft tuffs, which, over millennia, were meticulously eroded by wind and water, leaving behind the distinctive, towering formations we see today.

Known for their unique, fairy-tale-like shapes, many resemble mushrooms or pointed cones, creating a landscape unlike any other. Valleys like Paşabağı (Monks Valley) and Love Valley are particularly famous for showcasing these iconic formations in their most photogenic forms, often appearing in rose-tinted hues. A visit here immerses you in a truly unique visual spectacle. You'll wander through valleys filled with these towering structures, some even featuring carved openings and caves, offering a glimpse into the human history intertwined with this natural wonder. The sheer scale and intricate details of the 'chimneys' evoke a sense of awe, making Cappadocia one of Turkey's most enchanting destinations.
